    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Peruvian cuisine is definitely having a moment. It's actually been named one of the top 20 food trends in 2018! To call Peruvian food a “trend” sort of makes it seem like it’s something new and undiscovered, but Peruvian cuisine has been evolving for thousands of years and is popular all over the world. A major component of Peruvian cuisine centers around potatoes. In fact, there are more than 3,800 types of potatoes grown in the region! How amazing is that?
